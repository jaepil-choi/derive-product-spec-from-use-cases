"""Directive vocabulary for the Phase 2 control plane.

This module defines the shared value type that every decision site uses to
describe "what should happen next." In the Agent OS framing introduced by
the Phase-2 RFC, ``Directive`` members act as runtime-level syscalls: a
small, stable alphabet through which decision sites (evaluator, evolver,
resilience handlers, orchestrator, job manager) express control flow
without each inventing its own signalling.

Positioning within the Agent OS layers described by the RFC:

- Capability layer   — answers *what can this environment do?*
- Policy layer       — answers *who may use which capability?*
- **Directive layer  — answers what should happen next?*   (this module)*
- Event journal      — answers *why did the system move?*  (paired with the
                       ``control.directive.emitted`` event factory)

Design invariants:

- The enum is additive. Each member has a deliberate precondition and
  effect; additions require a PR-level justification.
- Exactly two members are terminal: ``CANCEL`` and ``CONVERGE``. Every
  other member implies the run continues.
- The vocabulary is intentionally small. New directives are introduced
  only when an existing one cannot carry the semantics without loss.
- Directives describe **workflow control**. They do not describe *capability
  policy* (whether a tool is visible/executable). Those concerns stay in
  the policy layer and in ``policy.*`` events.

Migration posture (mapping, not replacement):

Existing local enums — notably ``StepAction`` in the evolution loop, and
the terminal branches in ``evaluation/`` and ``resilience/`` — do not
disappear when this vocabulary lands. The first reference migration maps
``StepAction`` onto ``Directive`` at the adapter boundary::

    StepAction.STAGNATED  -> Directive.UNSTUCK
    StepAction.CONVERGED  -> Directive.CONVERGE
    StepAction.ONTOLOGY_STABLE -> Directive.EVALUATE
    StepAction.FAILED     -> Directive.RETRY  or Directive.CANCEL   (budget-dependent)

Later migrations follow the same pattern so callers can be converted one
at a time without flag days. This PR adds only the type and its
invariants; no caller is modified here.
