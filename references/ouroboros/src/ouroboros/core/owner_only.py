"""Owner-only writes for files that hold interview and data content.

Interview transcripts, Seeds, and fan-out records all carry whatever a data
lookup returned and whatever the user confirmed about it. They are written
under the process umask by default, which on a typical `022` leaves them
world-readable for their whole lifetime — indefinitely, in the case of
interview state and Seeds.

The protection cannot be an instruction to the writer to be careful: every
call site would have to remember, and one that forgets is invisible. It is a
function, applied at every site that persists this class of content, that
creates the file with mode `0600` rather than fixing the mode afterwards — so
the content never exists at the umask default even briefly.

    The content is written to a NEW file created at ``0600`` and then renamed
    over the target, so the mode is established at creation and never depends
    on repairing an existing file's permissions. That matters because the
    repair can fail — a filesystem without chmod, an EPERM on a file owned by
    someone else — and the earlier version suppressed that failure and wrote
    anyway, leaving the new secret at the old ``0644``. Here a
    failure to establish the mode is a failure to write: nothing sensitive
    reaches disk at a wider mode, ever.

    The replacement is atomic, so a reader never observes a partial file, and
    the temporary lives beside the target so the rename stays within one
    filesystem. Contents and directory entry are both fsync'd, and the return
    value reports whether that durability could be confirmed — callers that
    persist state a user would notice losing should log when it could not.

    Establishing the mode at creation is also what keeps an *existing*
    world-readable file from staying that way. Preserving the previous mode,
    the usual behaviour for an atomic-write helper, would carry a `0644` file
    written by an older version forward forever.
