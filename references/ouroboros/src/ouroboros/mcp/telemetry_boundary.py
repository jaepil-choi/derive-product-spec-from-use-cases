# version of this gate trusted the class's own __module__ string -- but
# __module__ is just an attribute an extension-defined class can set to
# anything ("builtins", "ouroboros_acme_private.errors", ...), and it is not
# even guaranteed to be a string, so reading it could itself raise and
# replace the real Result.err with an AttributeError (breaking the
# never-raises contract this module promises). This gate instead uses a
# CLOSED output vocabulary: only class *names* enumerated in
# _SAFE_ERROR_TYPE_NAMES are ever serialized verbatim, and that set is built
# from sources we control, never from anything the error object claims about
# itself. This makes even a spoofed name harmless -- a class calling itself
# "ValueError" serializes the audited string "ValueError", which identifies
# no one. Kept distinct from _UNKNOWN_TOOL_NAME (a different axis: that one
# is about an unresolved tool name, this one is about an error class).

    is wrapped and any exception folds to the same safe literal a
    non-audited name would. The boundary's never-raises contract must hold

    exit, it is an extension-controlled property choosing an exception

    the caller's real result. Swallowing it here is correct: this function
