"""Deterministic working-set selection for focused evolution.

Loop engineering converges by shrinking the work that remains.  This module
turns the previous generation's verification evidence into an explicit AC
working set: failed, changed, challenged, regressed, and newly-added nodes stay
active; proven passing nodes are frozen and only reverified at the boundary.

The selector is deliberately independent of LLM output such as
``ReflectOutput.settled_ac_indices``.  A model may propose a change, but it does
not decide which already-passing nodes are safe to rerun.
