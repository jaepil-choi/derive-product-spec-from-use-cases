"""Durable single-owner lease over one lineage's evolve_step boundary (#1889).

Two concurrent ``evolve_step`` calls used to replay the same lineage state,
select the same generation number, run the external executor twice, and
append duplicate completion and terminal events. The lease here serializes
the whole replay/selection/execution boundary per lineage, and it is decided
at the database boundary so it holds across loop instances and processes
sharing one store:

- The lease is acquired *before* the caller replays lineage state, so a
  loser never observes a stale snapshot, never writes ``lineage.created``
  for an attempt it cannot run, and can never select a generation number
  while another generation is still executing.
- ``acquire`` inserts the lease inside a single write transaction; the
  primary key makes a concurrent second insert lose deterministically.
- The owner heartbeats the lease while working; ``release`` deletes it on
  exit, including on interruption, so a resuming caller re-replays fresh
  state under its own lease — a released lease is an invitation to replay,
  never to reuse a previously selected generation.
- A lease that stops being refreshed for ``lease_seconds`` is presumed
  crashed and may be reclaimed — in two phases: the reclaimer first marks
  the lease revoked, then takes ownership only after a grace period of one
  heartbeat interval. A revoked lease refuses the owner's refresh, so a
  scheduling owner provably observes the transfer and stops inside the
  grace window, before the successor can begin. Phase two is open to any
  caller — the revocation carries no reclaimer identity, so a fresh retry
  completes a graced reclaim — and each phase is a compare-and-set on the
  observed state, so two reclaimers cannot both win. Fencing is two-sided:
  an owner that observes a replacement token stops immediately, and an
  owner that cannot *prove* ownership (refresh outage) fences itself once
  half the lease has elapsed since its last confirmed refresh — strictly
  before a reclaimer is allowed to steal at the full lease — so a stale
  attempt can never continue effects alongside its successor. The loss is
  exposed on the yielded lease handle so the caller aborts in-flight work.

Stores that expose no database URL (unit-test fakes) or an in-memory URL
(private to one process by construction) fall back to a per-store claim
table with identical semantics.
