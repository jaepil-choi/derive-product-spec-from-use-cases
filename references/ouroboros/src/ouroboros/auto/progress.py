"""Structured progress events for ``ooo auto`` sessions.

Observers (CLI streaming, MCP history, TUI/HUD) subscribe to a single
``AutoProgressCallback`` to render auto pipeline progress without scraping the
persisted JSON state. The dataclass is intentionally narrow so future surfaces
can extend it without a breaking change to the contract that lives here.

    Each event is a *snapshot* of the current pipeline state at the
    moment of emission, not a delta. Consumers should treat the stream
    as "the latest known state plus selected milestones".

    ``kind`` is the discriminant:

    - ``phase``: the pipeline phase just changed since the last
      observation. ``AutoPipeline`` also emits a ``phase`` event on the
      first save of every ``run()`` invocation — including resume paths
      where no fresh transition occurred in this process — so observers
      always learn the current phase without polling the store.
    - ``grade``: a Seed review produced a new grade since the last
      observation.
    - ``repair``: the repair round counter advanced since the last
      observation.
    - ``question``: the auto interview produced or resumed a question.
    - ``answer``: the auto answerer submitted a source-tagged answer.
