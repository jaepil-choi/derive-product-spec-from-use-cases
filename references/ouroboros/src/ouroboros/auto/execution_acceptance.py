    Normalization rewrites known-equivalent criteria to a canonical text.  That

    properties simultaneously:

    - **Identity** — a source carrying an explicit contract or an explicitly
      supplied ``semantic_ac_key`` is never merged away or stripped.  A canonical
      text that would conflate *distinct* identities refuses the collapse and
      keeps each source verbatim.  Bare/legacy equivalents (auto-derived keys,
      no contract) still collapse to one plain string.
    - **Order** — every emitted criterion is anchored to its originating source
      position and re-sorted, so a refused collapse or an autoresearch
      replacement can never move a contract ahead of or behind its siblings
      (sequential execution reads tuple order as stage order).
    - **Loss-free** — a caller-authored criterion is never deleted to satisfy a
      downstream constraint. Two criteria that arrive sharing a description keep
      both contracts; a canonical text seen twice never manufactures a phantom
      contractless duplicate.
