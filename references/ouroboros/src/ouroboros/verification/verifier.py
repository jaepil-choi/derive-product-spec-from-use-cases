    Three answers, not two: True, False, and None for "this reading cannot tell".
    An unknown construct or a tree deeper than `_MAX_PARSE_DEPTH` is None, and so
    is anything built out of a None.

    The third answer is what keeps the doubt pointed at refusal. Refusal is the
    safe direction — a pattern wrongly called nullable costs an honest criterion
    a formal failure, while one wrongly called discriminating is admitted as
    evidence, which is the defect this file exists to close — but "safe" is a
    direction, and `(?!…)` reverses direction. Answering an unreadable inner
    pattern with a plain True and then negating it produces a confident False:
    the guard would report *certainty that the pattern discriminates* on the
    strength of not having understood it. None negates to None, so the doubt
    survives the negation and `_matches_the_empty_string` still refuses.

    `groups` carries, for each capture group once seen, what it can itself match
    and whether it can have taken part in an empty match — the first so a
    backreference can be judged by what it refers to, the second so a conditional
    can be judged by which arm it would run.

    `on_path` says what the match did with the path being walked, and is itself
    three-valued: True for a path the match certainly took, False for one it
    certainly did not — the inside of a negative assertion, which succeeds only
    by failing — and None where it may have gone either way.

    `withheld` names anchors to read as ones that cannot hold, and `porous`
    reads a consuming atom as something a match can cross rather than something
    that ends the question. Together they turn this walk into a second question
    asked of the same tree — "can this match somewhere that is not the start of

    `\A\Z` and `\A\s*\Z` match a subject with nothing in it, and the empty-string

    them. A pattern that can match nothing *somewhere in the middle* matches
    every file there is, so its match is evidence of nothing; these match one
    file and no other, which makes them not the weakest evidence available but
    the sharpest. Refusing them failed the one criterion they are the right
    answer to — that a file be left empty — and left it needing a rescue that
    read the criterion's English instead, which is guesswork this file should
    not be doing.

    Three readings, none of which runs the pattern. Nothing it consumes may be
    content, or the file it matched had something in it. No match may begin
    anywhere but the start of the subject, and none may end anywhere but the
    end, or what matched was a blank stretch inside a file rather than the whole
    of one — asked by walking the same tree twice more with one end of the
    subject withheld, which forces every match to justify itself without that
    end. Both walks answering "cannot" is what says both ends were required.

    Only `\A` and `\Z` count as the ends of the subject, so `\A$` and `(?m)^$`
    are refused rather than admitted — see `_START_ANCHORS`. That costs a
    criterion written with `$` the failure it already gets today, and it is the

        and it is the direction with no safe stopping point: what a regex match
        proves about a criterion depends on whether the pattern is really about
        that criterion, and nothing available here can settle that. A rule that
        reads the criterion's wording admits `class\\s+\\w+` for "a
        CameraProvider class" through the shared word `class`; tightening it to
        read named targets from their spelling admits `MUST` through ordinary

        because the question — does this text name this criterion's subject —
        is not one a finite reading of prose answers.
