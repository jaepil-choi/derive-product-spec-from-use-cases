"""Opt-in shadow-replay baseline harness (frugality-proof AC5).

The deterministic frugality proof
(:mod:`ouroboros.orchestrator.frugality_proof`) can only judge the hypothesis
"decomposed children run token-frugal at a cheaper tier" once every counted row
carries a BASELINE: *what would this child have cost at the PARENT's tier/effort?*
That opt-in baseline is the experiment-only axis
(:data:`~ouroboros.orchestrator.frugality_proof.EVENT_SHADOW_REPLAY`). This module
produces it by re-executing a decomposed child's workspace-remapped prompt at the
parent's model tier and reasoning effort, measuring the token spend, and emitting
``execution.ac.shadow_replay``.

Default OFF, on purpose. Replaying doubles a child's token cost, so this is an
experiment harness — never a production default. It is gated by
``OUROBOROS_SHADOW_REPLAY`` (see :func:`shadow_replay_enabled_from_env`) read once
in the runner and threaded to the executor, and it runs fire-and-forget: any
failure degrades to a warning and never disturbs the real AC's result.

Replay isolation (a HARD safety requirement)
---------------------------------------------
The baseline re-executes the same prompt WITH TOOLS, which would mutate the real
task workspace a second time. The executor therefore captures a disposable,
filtered filesystem snapshot of the task cwd (:func:`isolated_workspace`)
*immediately before* dispatching the live child, then gives that frozen snapshot
to the replay only after the child succeeds. This ordering matters: creating a
detached worktree after the live child finishes would silently drop both the
caller's pre-existing uncommitted files and the exact pre-child state, so the two
models would not receive the same input. Exact live-cwd strings in the generated
prompt are remapped to the snapshot path.

The snapshot deliberately excludes ``.git`` instead of sharing a worktree's Git
metadata with an untrusted baseline agent. A shared object database/ref namespace
would let replayed tools mutate the live repository even when source files live in
another directory. The trade-off is explicit: prompts whose behavior depends on
Git history/status cannot be compared faithfully by this harness and should be
treated as unsupported experiment inputs. Ordinary tracked modifications and
untracked task files are copied, while large regenerable dependency/cache folders
are filtered. If isolation cannot be established (including an escaping symlink),
the replay is SKIPPED — the harness never re-executes against the live workspace.

The copy is input state, not a security boundary. A replay runtime must separately
attest strict read/write confinement to that cwd *and* isolation of network, MCP,
API, deployment, messaging, database, and every other external side-effect path.
No bundled production runtime currently attests both, so all of them skip replay
and emit no baseline. Likewise, ACs with ``verify_command`` are unsupported: a
host-side shell would sit outside the runtime sandbox and could escape via an
absolute path or ``cd ../..``.

How grounding regression stays honest without a baseline journal
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``grounding_regression`` on the deliver-verdict axis means "the child at the cheap
tier newly REJECTED a claim the parent-tier baseline ACCEPTED". Computing it needs
BOTH the child's deliver verdict (already produced by the live executor) AND a
BASELINE deliver verdict. A baseline deliver verdict requires a baseline
:class:`~ouroboros.harness.deliver_gate.EvidenceManifest`, and that manifest is
built from recorded journal events. The live path may additionally admit an
accepted attempt's ``execution.tool.started`` rows, but only after typed evidence
exactly matches them and the independent harness verifier passes. Mutation starts
also require one correlated successful completion. The baseline
runs via a bare ``adapter.execute_task`` in an isolated workspace whose events are
deliberately NOT recorded (recording them would splice a second execution's
evidence into the proof's event stream). The raw baseline stream does pass the
fat-harness typed-evidence and transcript verifier against the snapshot, but there
is no throwaway journal/TraceGuard manifest, so a paired baseline deliver verdict
is not computable without expanding the experiment harness substantially.

Rather than fake a paired baseline verdict, the live deliver-verdict producer
uses an explicit fail-closed policy. A journal-grounded accepted child records
``grounding_regression=false`` because it was not rejected at the lower tier. A
rejected child records ``grounding_regression=true`` conservatively: without a
baseline journal Ouroboros cannot prove the parent would also reject it, so the
zero-regression veto wins. The event records
``grounding_regression_mode=fail_closed_live_traceguard`` to distinguish this
policy from a future exact paired-verdict comparison. This replay module remains
responsible only for the paired token baseline.
