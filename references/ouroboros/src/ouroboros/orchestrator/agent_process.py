"""``AgentProcess`` — cooperative lifecycle for long-running workflows.

Issue #518 — M6 of the Phase-2 Agent OS RFC. The five verbs ``spawn``,
``pause``, ``resume``, ``cancel``, and ``replay`` are the unified
abstraction every long-running workflow consumes (ralph, evolve_step,
execute_seed). This module is the AgentProcess spine for #518: the
interface, cooperative ``cancel()``, ``pause()``, ``resume()``, and
``status()`` operations, lifecycle directive emission that lands
``control.directive.emitted`` events with ``target_type="agent_process"``,
durable pause checkpoints, and ``replay()`` projection from the persisted
lifecycle journal.

Cooperative semantics, locked here:

* ``cancel()`` sets a flag. The work loop checks it at deterministic
  points (start of each AC iteration, before each LLM call, before
  each tool call — see #518 sub-thread). In-flight LLM/tool calls
  finish naturally; the loop exits at the next checkpoint.
* ``pause()`` sets a flag. The work loop awaits
  :meth:`AgentProcessHandle.wait_unpaused` whenever it reaches a
  checkpoint, releasing only when ``resume()`` is called.
* Per #476, the trust model is cooperative: a misbehaving work
  function can ignore the flags, but the runtime does not police
  identity. Forced kill is Tier-3 C2 territory, gated by evidence.

Lifecycle directive emission, per the body of #518:

* On every status transition the runtime appends a
  ``control.directive.emitted`` event with
  ``target_type="agent_process"`` and ``target_id=<process_id>``.
* Mapping (locked): pause → ``WAIT``, resume → ``CONTINUE``,
  cancel → ``CANCEL``, complete → ``CONVERGE``.
* Internal loop directives (``RETRY``, ``EVOLVE`` …) are *not*
  emitted by this module — those are the workflow's job
  (e.g. evolution emits ``RETRY``/``CONVERGE`` itself per #525).

The module deliberately does not import any handler-side type so
adopting :class:`AgentProcess` is a one-import change for the three
reference migrations in slices 4–6 of #518.
