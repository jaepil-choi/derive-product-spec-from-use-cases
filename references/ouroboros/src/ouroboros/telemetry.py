"""Anonymous usage telemetry (PostHog).

Privacy contract — see TELEMETRY.md at the repository root:

- Never collects code, prompts, seed content, file paths, or arguments.
  Only event names and coarse properties (command, backend, version, os,
  duration, success) are sent.
- Identity is a random UUID stored in ``~/.ouroboros/telemetry.json``.
  No PII, no machine fingerprinting.
- Opt out any time: ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1``, ``OUROBOROS_TELEMETRY=0``, or
  ``telemetry.enabled: false`` in ``~/.ouroboros/config.yaml``.
- Fire-and-forget: events go through a bounded queue drained by a daemon
  thread using stdlib urllib. Telemetry never raises, never blocks the
  caller, and silently drops events on any failure. The worker thread is a
  daemon, so process exit never waits on it either: events still queued or
  in flight when the process terminates are dropped, not delivered.
