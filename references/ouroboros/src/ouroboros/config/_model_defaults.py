"""Single source of truth for default Claude model pins.

Every config default (Pydantic field defaults in :mod:`ouroboros.config.models`,
the ``get_*_model`` fallbacks in :mod:`ouroboros.config.loader`, and the setup
wizard tables in :mod:`ouroboros.cli.commands.setup`) references the constants
below. Bumping a pinned model is therefore a one-line edit here instead of
shotgun surgery across three layers. See Q00/ouroboros#1322.

From the Claude 4.6 generation onward, model IDs are dateless but still pinned
snapshots (not evergreen pointers), so pinning remains fully reproducible:
https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview

These pins intentionally do NOT use the ``"default"`` sentinel: the evaluation
and consensus phases depend on a stable model tier for reproducible grading.

Scope: these constants cover the Anthropic-direct API ids (used by the
``claude``/``litellm`` backends) and the OpenRouter consensus roster. The
Copilot setup path selects models from GitHub Copilot's own discovery catalog
(distinct dotted ids surfaced by ``copilot.model_discovery``) and is therefore
out of scope here — it is not driven by these pins.

Note on id formats across providers (they are NOT interchangeable):
- Anthropic direct API uses hyphenated, dateless ids: ``claude-opus-4-8``.
- OpenRouter uses dotted slugs: ``anthropic/claude-opus-4.8``
  (https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-opus-4.8).

# the pre-EOL QA default). Backends that cannot run Claude model names
# (Codex/Copilot/Hermes/Kiro) must treat these legacy shipped defaults exactly
# like the current shipped default and normalize them to the ``"default"``
# sentinel — otherwise bumping a pin silently reclassifies an untouched shipped
# default in an already-persisted config as an explicit user override and leaks
# a Claude id to a backend that cannot execute it (Q00/ouroboros#1324 review).

# Historical shipped default pins for the ``economics.tiers`` model ladder,
# keyed by the legacy id and valued by the CURRENT shipped id that replaced it.
# Same rationale as LEGACY_DEFAULT_MODELS (Q00/ouroboros#1324), applied to the
# tier ladder that model-tier routing reads: a user's persisted
# ``~/.ouroboros/config.yaml`` written by an older release still carries the OLD
# shipped tier defaults verbatim (the defaults ship as concrete ids inside
# EconomicsConfig, not a ``"default"`` sentinel). When a pin is bumped, an
# untouched shipped default in that persisted config is otherwise
# indistinguishable from a deliberate user override — so per-call model-tier
# routing would enforce a retired id (e.g. ``--model gpt-4o``) that the current
# provider map cannot execute, failing every AC. Normalizing a legacy shipped id
# to its current replacement keeps the shipped defaults live across a bump. This
# necessarily means a deliberate override that is byte-for-byte equal to an old
# shipped default is normalized too: the persisted schema carries no provenance
# bit that could distinguish those cases. Explicit ids that were never shipped
# (for example a proxy-specific model) remain untouched.
#
# Verified against git history of ``ouroboros.config.models`` (the tier defaults
# have only ever held these ids): openai frugal ``gpt-4o-mini`` -> standard
# ``gpt-4o`` -> frontier ``o3`` became ``gpt-5.1-codex-mini`` / ``gpt-5-codex`` /
# ``gpt-5.2``; anthropic frugal ``claude-3-5-haiku``, standard
# ``claude-sonnet-4-20250514``, frontier ``claude-opus-4-5-20251101`` (and the
# later frontier ``claude-opus-4-6``) became the DEFAULT_*_MODEL pins. The google
# tier ids (``gemini-2.0-flash`` / ``gemini-2.5-pro``) have never been bumped, so
