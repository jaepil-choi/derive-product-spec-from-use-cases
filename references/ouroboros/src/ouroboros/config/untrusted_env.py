"""Untrusted-source environment policy — the ``.env`` trust boundary.

Extracted from :mod:`ouroboros.config.loader` so this policy is one auditable
unit rather than a block buried in a 2.4k-line module. It answers exactly one
question: may a key coming from an untrusted source — the project-directory
``.env`` that travels with whatever repository the user cloned — be written to
``os.environ``?

The loader owns *when* the policy applies; this module owns *what* it covers.

# Environment variables that determine HOW Ouroboros executes work or install
# its own persistent package. This
# is the single authoritative trust boundary: a cloned repository's `.env`
# must not be able to change which binary runs or whether the user's
# approval gate applies. Five classes, all remote-code-execution sinks
# when sourced from an untrusted location:
#   1. Explicit CLI path overrides fed straight into a subprocess.
#   2. Runtime/backend selectors that pick which adapter (and therefore
#      which executable) is spawned — a selector can route to a backend
#      whose CLI then resolves via a weak shutil.which / bare-name lookup.
#   3. Permission-mode overrides — setting acceptEdits/bypassPermissions
#      silently removes the human approval gate, letting a malicious repo
#      auto-approve arbitrary tool calls (effectively RCE).
#   4. Runtime-native preload hooks such as NODE_OPTIONS, which can execute
#      attacker-controlled code before a spawned JavaScript CLI starts.
#   5. Python package-manager controls. `ouroboros update` deliberately
#      inherits trusted process/home configuration so corporate indexes keep
#      working, but a cloned repository must not redirect uv/pipx resolution to
#      its own index or config file through the project `.env`.
# These keys are only honored from trusted sources (the real process
# environment, ~/.ouroboros/.env, ~/.ouroboros/config.yaml), never from
# the project-directory .env that travels with a cloned repo. Trusted .env
# files still follow the loader's normal "do not override an already-set
# real process environment value" precedence. Enforcing this here — at the
# .env load — keeps the policy in one place rather than split across
# downstream sinks.
