"""Mechanical command configuration built from ``.ouroboros/mechanical.toml``.

Ouroboros no longer ships hardcoded per-language presets. Instead,
``ouroboros.evaluation.detector`` runs a single AI call that inspects the
repo and writes ``.ouroboros/mechanical.toml`` with commands this project
can actually execute. This module is the deterministic reader for that
file: Stage 1 trusts the toml and nothing else.

Usage:
    config = build_mechanical_config(Path("/path/to/project"))
    verifier = MechanicalVerifier(config)

When the toml is absent, all commands resolve to ``None`` and Stage 1
skips gracefully rather than running the wrong tool.
