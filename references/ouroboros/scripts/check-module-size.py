"""Ratchet the size of `src/ouroboros` modules so god-modules can only shrink.

Why this exists: per Q00/ouroboros#1797, `OrchestratorRunner` reached 11,100
lines across 180 methods inside an 11,980-line module, and `parallel_executor.py`
reached 13,158. A 2026-08-01 measurement of `src/ouroboros` found 486 Python
files with a median of 297 lines -- but the 26 files above 2,000 lines hold
35.3% of all source. The distribution is not gradual; it is a small set of
gravity wells that absorb every new concern because no other home is obvious.

Nothing stops that today. #1769 added ~324 lines and nine private methods to
`runner.py` while under review, and no gate noticed. This script is the
mechanical floor under the #1797 extraction work: it does not split anything,
it only guarantees the numbers cannot go back up between extraction PRs.

The rule has two halves:

1. Any module NOT in GRANDFATHERED must stay at or under SOFT_CAP lines.
   The cap sits in a natural gap in the distribution -- no file in the
   repository is currently between 1,800 and 2,000 lines -- so it cannot bite
   an ordinary module by accident.

2. A module IN GRANDFATHERED must stay at or under its recorded budget, and
   must RE-SEED once it drops more than RESEED_SLACK below it. The re-seed
   half is what makes this a ratchet rather than a static cap: without it, a
   PR that removes 500 lines leaves the old headroom available for the next
   contributor to spend. The failure message prints the exact replacement
   line, so satisfying it is a one-line edit in the same PR.

3. The policy itself may only tighten. GRANDFATHERED, SOFT_CAP, RESEED_SLACK,
   EXCLUDED, SOURCE_ROOT, and MODULE_GLOB are editable in the same commit they
   gate, so measuring source against the *proposed* policy proves nothing on
   its own: a PR could grow a module and raise its budget together, add a new
   oversized module and grandfather it, or simply narrow the measured tree.
   The proposed policy is therefore compared with the base branch's: no key or
   exclusion may be added, no budget may increase, neither numeric limit may
   rise, and measurement scope must remain identical. Removals and decreases
   are the only permitted directions for debt and numeric limits.

Physical lines are counted, including blanks and comments. That is gameable by
writing longer lines. `line-length = 100` in pyproject.toml makes that awkward,
but it is not a hard bound -- `E501` is in the ruff ignore list, and the
formatter cannot split a long string literal or URL. The count is a proxy for
what costs a reviewer, not a tamper-proof metric; the base-branch comparison in
rule 3 is what actually makes the gate hard to walk around.

Run locally:
    python3 scripts/check-module-size.py                    # current state only
    python3 scripts/check-module-size.py --baseline-ref origin/main

CI:
    .github/workflows/module-size.yml runs this on every PR with
    the immutable PR base SHA, and on main pushes with the pre-push SHA.
    checkout uses fetch-depth: 0 so either predecessor is available.

Retiring an entry:
    When a grandfathered module falls to SOFT_CAP or below, delete its line
    from GRANDFATHERED entirely. It is then held by the universal cap and, by
    rule 3, can never be grandfathered again. That deletion is the unit of
    progress on #1797.
