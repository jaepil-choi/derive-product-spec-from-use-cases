## Summary

`ooo run` now carries an execution through formal evaluation and, on explicit
rejection, into the existing bounded Ralph evolution loop. Harness grading
commands/assertions remain hidden from workers, while retries receive sanitized
facts about missing artifacts, observed commands/files, and verifier output.

The production composition root now owns the entire successor chain:

```text
StartExecuteSeedHandler
  -> StartEvaluateHandler
    -> StartRalphHandler
      -> EvolveStepHandler
        -> EvolutionaryLoop
```

Each arrow is an injected, shared handler instance. Chained execution no longer
constructs bare handlers at runtime, which previously caused the first real
Ralph iteration to terminate with `EvolutionaryLoop not configured` even
though constructor-mocked tests passed.

Passive OpenCode, Codex, and Hermes builtin interception now resolve through
the same configured graph rather than the former lightweight definition
factory. Backend handle aliases such as `codex_cli` and `hermes_cli` are
canonicalized before deciding whether the injected runtime owner can be reused.
Each runtime retains the complete configured tool composition, including its
MCP server resource owner. `shutdown_configured_runtime_tools()` provides
deterministic EventStore, ControlBus, and bridge teardown.

When OpenCode passive-plugin dispatch is active, an evaluation with
`auto_evolve: true` remains parent-owned and pollable. The parent runs the
formal evaluator through its in-process path so it receives the verdict and
can seed generation 1 before starting Ralph. Plugin-only delegation remains
the behavior when automatic evolution is disabled.

## Configuration

```yaml
execution:
  auto_evaluate: true
  auto_evolve: true
  auto_evolve_max_generations: 3
```

`auto_evolve` is also a per-call override. Its resolved boolean and the automatic
generation budget are snapshotted when evaluation is enqueued. The budget is
clamped to 1..10 and bound to the lineage through a durable policy claim before
the Ralph successor starts. The successor receipt records both `job_id` and the
authoritative budget, so later configuration changes cannot rewrite replay
behavior or metadata. Auto pipeline run dispatches explicitly set both
`auto_evaluate: false` and `auto_evolve: false`: Auto already owns its Ralph
handoff and final formal evaluation, so the run boundary must not create a
second evaluation owner or a competing Ralph lineage.

The detached run request likewise carries resolved `auto_evaluate` and
`auto_evolve` booleans. A restarted execute owner therefore cannot change
whether it creates evaluation or Ralph successors by reading newer config.

## Testing

- Original feature regression suite: 1,261 passed.
- Corrective convergence suite: 769 passed.
- Mock-free boundary test: rejected Gen 1 evaluation -> real Ralph job -> real
  `EvolveStepHandler` -> real `EvolutionaryLoop` -> completed generation 2;
  the prior passing AC is frozen, the failed AC is active, and Ralph stops on
  `qa passed`.
- Composition test: the registered run/evaluate/Ralph/evolve handlers reuse
  the same configured instances.
- Ruff: all checks passed.
- Mypy: no issues in 513 source files.

## Known Limitations

- The optional model-based coach rewrite remains intentionally deferred; retry
  hints are deterministic.
- Single-AC evaluations without checklist metadata use Ralph's existing
  full-graph focus fallback.
- Plugin Seed handoffs are intentionally process-local until redemption. The
  parent consumes the opaque handle exactly once, restores the raw Seed into its private
  evaluation request, and gives a detached evaluation owner no process-local
  handle to resolve. If evaluation itself is delegated, the parent derives its
  checklist from the raw Seed but passes only the same worker-safe projection.
  That projection removes verifier keys and redacts every raw, quoted, or
  escaped occurrence of their values across the final worker prompt, context,
  artifacts, and separately rendered checklist text using the same longest-first
  contract redactor as retry hints. Raw verifier material remains absent from
  plugin-worker prompts and worker-queryable events.

- The confidentiality boundary covers data transported by Ouroboros into
  worker prompts, contexts, events, artifacts, and retry surfaces. It is not a
  filesystem sandbox: if an operator stores the original raw Seed in a location
  that the worker's Read/Bash capabilities can access, the worker may still
  discover that file independently. Strong holdout isolation therefore also
  requires placing raw Seeds outside the worker-visible workspace or running
  the worker with an appropriate filesystem sandbox.

- Run-to-evaluation arguments retain the source execution completion status.
  A failed-but-evaluable run can be formally judged and evolved without being
  rewritten as a successfully completed Generation 1 during durable replay.
