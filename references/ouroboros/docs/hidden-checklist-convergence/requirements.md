## Original Request

Turn one-shot `ooo run` execution into a bounded convergence chain while keeping
harness-owned grading inputs hidden from implementation workers. Failed but
evaluable runs proceed through formal evaluation and focused Ralph evolution;
the preceding verdict remains authoritative if successor chaining fails.

## Clarified Specification

- Hide every harness-owned `verify_command` and `output_assertion` from every
  Ouroboros-transported worker prompt, context, event, artifact, and retry
  surface without a configuration escape hatch. This contract does not claim
  to sandbox independently accessible raw Seed files.
- Build retry guidance from missing artifacts, sanitized verification output,
  and read-only worker tool/file evidence.
- Formally evaluate completed runs even when AC execution failed, provided an
  evaluable session/artifact exists.
- On explicit evaluation rejection, deterministically project the Seed and
  checklist into generation 1 and delegate convergence to Ralph.
- Preserve fail-open chaining: enqueue/parsing failures never change the run or
  evaluation verdict that preceded them.
- Avoid a second Ralph lineage inside `ooo auto`, which already owns its own
  RALPH_HANDOFF loop.

## Success Criteria

- Hidden contract strings do not appear in worker prompts.
- Run → evaluate → Ralph job IDs are transitively observable.
- Gen1 replay has `lineage.created` plus `lineage.generation.completed`, and the
  next planned generation is 2.
- Concurrent or replayed evaluation completions publish Gen1 and enqueue at most
  one Ralph successor; active and terminal successors are reattached by lineage.
- The resolved Ralph generation budget is snapshotted at evaluation enqueue and
  remains authoritative across configuration changes and successor replay.
- The resolved automatic-evolution enable/disable decision is part of the
  detached evaluation request and cannot flip when configuration changes.
- Approved/unjudged/opted-out evaluations do not enqueue Ralph.
- Static checks and the bounded target test suites pass.
- Builtin runtimes retain and can deterministically close the configured
  composition owner; backend handle aliases do not cause nested runtime creation.
