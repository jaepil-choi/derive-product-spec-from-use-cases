# #961 fat-harness baseline metrics capture

This is the recorded fixture baseline for the `agentos-substrate-wiring` gate.
It captures the #830/#961 hard-gate metrics without live model calls,
without `parallel_executor` wiring, and without changing `ooo run` defaults.

|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| FH-AC-001 | `fixture:thin-skill/decompose/accepted-first-try` | yes | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1600 | Verifier accepted the first atomic AC attempt. |
| FH-AC-002 | `fixture:thin-skill/evidence/accepted-first-try` | yes | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1620 | Evidence manifest matched the expected file claim. |
| FH-AC-003 | `fixture:profile/code/accepted-first-try` | yes | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1500 | Profile-aware prompt stayed inside the existing wrapper contract. |
| FH-AC-004 | `fixture:verifier/pass/accepted-first-try` | yes | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1760 | Verifier accepted without retry or redispatch. |
| FH-AC-005 | `fixture:retry/recovered-on-second-attempt` | yes | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1930 | Initial evidence miss recovered within K=2. |

## New-domain cost source

- Source: `docs/rfc/contract-ledger.md profile fixture adapter sketch`
- LOC delta: 42
- YAML delta: 1

## Gate conclusion

- 1-shot AC pass rate is captured as the baseline for later post-change comparison.
- K=2 recovery rate is measured against the >= 70% gate.
- Fabrication incidents are measured as verifier-detected incidents per 100 ACs.
- Semantic-miss incidents are sampled as evidence-backed-but-semantically-wrong incidents per 100 ACs.
- Median chars per AC is captured as the token-budget proxy baseline.
- New-domain cost is measured against <= 50 LOC + <= 1 YAML.
