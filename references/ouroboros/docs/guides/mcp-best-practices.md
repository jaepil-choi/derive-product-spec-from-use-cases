# MCP Best Practices

Use this guide when adding upstream MCP servers to Ouroboros through
`~/.ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml` or `{cwd}/.ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml`.

## Goals

External MCP servers should make the child agent more capable without making
execution brittle, slow, or unsafe. Prefer a small, named set of tools for one
workflow over a large always-on catalog.

## MCP 2026-07-28 Runtime Contract

Ouroboros uses the official Python SDK v2 as its protocol compatibility
boundary. The high-level SDK client runs in `mode="auto"`: it first performs
`server/discover` for MCP 2026-07-28 and falls back to the legacy `initialize`
handshake only when the peer is a handshake-era server. Application code must
not reproduce that negotiation, cache protocol results, or implement its own
multi-round-trip request state machine.

Modern Streamable HTTP is stateless and POST-oriented. Do not depend on
`Mcp-Session-Id`, HTTP GET event streams, or transport session affinity. Keep
workflow identity explicit in ordinary application data instead, for example
`session_id`, `execution_id`, and `job_id`. Those values are Ouroboros handles;
they are not MCP transport sessions and remain stable when a request moves to a
different worker.

SSE and the older HTTP+SSE transport are deprecated compatibility options. Use
STDIO for local subprocess servers and modern Streamable HTTP for remote
servers. When an upstream server only supports SSE, isolate that choice in its
server entry so it can be removed without changing the workflow contract.

### MCP and Claude process profiles

`mcp==2.0.0` and the current `claude-agent-sdk` cannot safely share one Python
interpreter: the Claude SDK embeds MCP 1.x internals and declares `mcp<2`.
Ouroboros therefore treats them as separate runtime profiles and processes:

- Run the Ouroboros protocol server/client boundary from the `[mcp]` profile.
- Run ordinary Claude SDK work through `[claude]` (or its explicit
  `[claude-sdk]` alias) in an MCP 1.x environment.
- Run the MCP 2 server from `[mcp]`; when Claude is the host, select the
  dependency-free `[claude-cli]` subprocess worker.
- Do not install `[mcp,claude]`, `[mcp,claude-sdk]`, or `[all,mcp]` together or override either package's
  declared dependency constraint.

This is a process boundary, not a feature flag. Data crossing it should use
explicit serializable requests and application handles rather than imported
SDK objects.

### Known SDK v2.0.0 limitation

The SDK model layer accepts arbitrary JSON for `structuredContent`, and the
Ouroboros mapper preserves JSON null. However, `mcp==2.0.0` currently drops an
explicit wire-level `structuredContent: null`; when a tool has an output schema,
the SDK validator then reports the value as missing. The dual-era integration
matrix keeps this case as a strict expected failure so a future SDK patch cannot
silently change behavior. Until that upstream defect is fixed, use an object or
array wrapper when a tool needs to distinguish an explicit JSON null from an
absent structured result.

## Recommended Server Roles

| Server | Use when | Typical scope |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| OpenCron | Scheduled browser or synthetic checks are part of verification | QA and monitoring tasks only |
| Figma | Design artifacts must guide implementation | Read-only design inspection |
| Context7 | Current library/framework documentation is needed | Documentation lookup during planning or implementation |
| Tavily | External web research is required | Research and source discovery |

## Quick Setup

For a user-wide setup, create the MCP config file under `~/.ouroboros`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ouroboros
$EDITOR ~/.ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml
chmod 600 ~/.ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml
```

Paste the YAML shape from the next section, then replace each placeholder
command with the MCP server command used in your environment. Keep API keys in
environment variables and reference them as `${VAR_NAME}` in the YAML.

Ouroboros discovers upstream MCP config in this order:

1. `$OUROBOROS_MCP_CONFIG`
2. `~/.ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml`
3. `{cwd}/.ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml`

Use the home config for servers you want available across projects. Use the
project-local config when the server list or credentials are specific to one
repository. To bypass discovery for one run, pass an explicit path:

```bash
ouroboros run seed.yaml --mcp-config .ouroboros/mcp_servers.yaml
```

For the bridge lifecycle quick start, see
[`docs/guides/mcp-bridge.md`](./mcp-bridge.md).

## Configuration Pattern

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: context7
    transport: stdio
    command: "<context7-mcp-command>"
    args: []
    timeout: 30

  - name: tavily
    transport: stdio
    command: "<tavily-mcp-command>"
    args: []
    env:
      TAVILY_API_KEY: "${TAVILY_API_KEY}"
    timeout: 45

  - name: figma
    transport: stdio
    command: "<figma-mcp-command>"
    args: []
    env:
      FIGMA_TOKEN: "${FIGMA_TOKEN}"
    timeout: 30

  - name: opencron
    transport: stdio
    command: "<opencron-mcp-command>"
    args: []
    timeout: 60

connection:
  timeout_seconds: 30
  retry_attempts: 3
  health_check_interval: 60
```

Replace the placeholder commands with the server package or wrapper used by
your environment. Keep credentials in environment variables rather than in the
YAML file.

## Naming

Use stable, domain-oriented server names: `context7`, `tavily`, `figma`,
`opencron`. Avoid names such as `tools` or `research` because they make logs and
tool provenance harder to audit.

If a server exports generic tool names, add `tool_prefix` in the MCP config or
wrap the server with prefixed tool names. Built-in agent tools take precedence;
colliding MCP tools may be skipped.

## Security

- Use read-only tokens for Figma and documentation servers when possible.
- Do not grant browser or filesystem tools to research-only workflows.
- Store API keys in the environment and reference them as `${VAR_NAME}`.
- Keep `mcp_servers.yaml` out of shared logs and examples when it contains
  private URLs, headers, or workspace IDs.
- Prefer separate server entries per trust boundary. For example, do not put a
  public web-research tool and an internal data tool behind the same wrapper.

## Reliability

- Set per-server `timeout` based on expected latency. Browser/synthetic QA
  servers usually need more time than documentation lookup servers.
- Keep `connection.retry_attempts` at 2 or 3. Higher values can hide broken
  credentials and slow every execution.
- Use health checks for long-running sessions, but do not rely on them as a
  substitute for per-call timeouts.
- If a workflow only needs one external server, configure only that server for
  the run. Smaller catalogs reduce startup and tool-selection noise.

## Workflow Mapping

| Workflow | Suggested servers |
|----------|-------------------|
| Research -> Deliverable | Tavily, Context7 |
| Design -> Code -> Verify | Figma, Context7, OpenCron |
| Library upgrade | Context7, optional Tavily |
| Launch QA | OpenCron, optional Context7 |

See `docs/examples/workflows/` for concrete workflow examples.
