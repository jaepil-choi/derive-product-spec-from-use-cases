# OpenCode Subagent Bridge Plugin

> OpenCode plugin that routes Ouroboros MCP tool calls into native OpenCode
> Task panes backed by **independent child sessions**, giving each subagent
> a clean LLM context while the main session stays uncluttered.

## What it does

When the main LLM invokes an Ouroboros MCP tool that emits a `_subagent` /
`_subagents` envelope, the bridge dispatches the work into a child session.
Tools that dispatch via the plugin when `runtime_backend=opencode` and
`opencode_mode=plugin` (default):

| Tool | Envelope | Child role |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `ouroboros_qa` | `_subagent` | QA judge |
| `ouroboros_lateral_think` (`persona=all`) | `_subagents` | one child per persona |
| `ouroboros_lateral_think` (single persona) | `_subagent` | single persona child |
| `ouroboros_interview` | `_subagent` | Socratic interviewer |
| `ouroboros_pm_interview` | `_subagent` | PM interviewer |
| `ouroboros_generate_seed` | `_subagent` | seed architect |
| `ouroboros_execute_seed` | `_subagent` | executor |
| `ouroboros_start_execute_seed` | `_subagent` | executor (background job) |
| `ouroboros_evolve_step` | `_subagent` | evolution generation |
| `ouroboros_start_evolve_step` | `_subagent` | evolution (background job) |
| `ouroboros_evaluate` | `_subagent` | evaluator |

For each payload the bridge **fire-and-forget** dispatches:

1. Parses the envelope in the `tool.execute.after` hook.
2. For each payload, AWAITS a **new child session** (`client.session.create`).
3. AWAITS PATCH of the original tool's assistant-message part with a
   `subtask` part (state `running`) via direct HTTP PATCH to
   `/session/{parent}/message/{mid}/part/{pid}` so the Task pane renders
   **inline** under the tool call with a spinner.
4. FIRES `client.session.prompt(...)` **without awaiting** — the child
   runs in the background.
5. Attaches `.then` / `.catch` handlers that PATCH the widget to
   `completed` (with `<task_result>` output) or `error` on failure.
6. Stamps the tool output with a human-readable dispatch banner +
   structured envelope in `metadata.ouroboros_dispatch`.

End result:

- Hook returns in ~100ms — main LLM is NOT blocked on child execution.
- Each subagent runs in its own child session — independent context, no
  cross-contamination.
- Task panes appear inline with live state: running → completed/error.
- Widget state is the source of truth for completion; OpenCode natively
  re-injects child output into the parent session when the widget
  transitions to `completed`.

### Dispatch envelope

`out.metadata.ouroboros_dispatch` carries a structured record:

```json
{
  "status": "dispatched" | "dispatch_failed" | "skipped" | "nothing",
  "mode": "plugin_subagent",
  "dispatched_at": "2026-04-17T…Z",
  "children": [{"title","childID","agent","tool","truncated"}],
  "failed":   [{"title","tool","reason?"}],
  "skipped":  [{"title","tool"}]
}
```

Downstream tooling can distinguish plugin-dispatched runs from
subprocess runs via `mode === "plugin_subagent"`.

When the Python handler includes contract keys in its response (e.g.
`job_id`, `session_id`, `status`), the bridge preserves them in
`out.metadata.ouroboros_response_shape`. This lets callers recover the
original tool contract even though `stamp()` overwrites the text content
with a human-readable banner.

## Why a bridge

Ouroboros MCP tools need isolated reasoning space for operations like QA
judgment, Socratic interview, multi-persona lateral thinking, and
evolutionary evaluation. Directly returning the subagent's work to the main
LLM pollutes its context and forces anchoring bias (especially for
multi-persona fan-out where each persona must think independently). The
bridge moves that work into child sessions while keeping the UI inline via
subtask parts.

## How it works

```
+--------------------+     +----------------------+     +---------------------+
| Main LLM turn      |     | Ouroboros MCP tool   |     | Bridge plugin       |
| calls ouroboros_*  | --> | emits _subagent(s)   | --> | tool.execute.after  |
+--------------------+     +----------------------+     +----------+----------+
                                                                   |
                       +-------------------------------------------+
                       |  for each payload (fire-and-forget):      |
                       v                                           |
          +-----------------------------+       +------------------+-------+
          | AWAIT session.create        |       | PATCH session/{parent}/  |
          | -> new childID              |       | message/{mid}/part/{pid} |
          | AWAIT patch: state=running  | ----> | body { type:"subtask",   |
          | FIRE session.prompt (no     |       |        sessionID:child,  |
          |   await) + .then/.catch     |       |        state:"running" } |
          +--------------+--------------+       +--------------------------+
                         |                                  ^
                         |  on child finish (bg):           |
                         +----------------------------------+
                            PATCH state=completed|error
                         |
                         v
          +-----------------------------+
          | Hook returns ~100ms         |
          | Task pane spins → completes |
          +-----------------------------+
```

### Fan-out model (multi-persona)

`ouroboros_lateral_think` (and any tool emitting `_subagents: [...]`) spawns
**N independent child sessions** in parallel — one per persona. Each child
receives only its own prompt, so the five lateral-thinking personas produce
**unconflicted** angles with no anchoring bias.

| Aspect               | Behaviour |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Dispatch model       | One child session per subagent payload |
| Parallelism          | All children spawn concurrently; patches serialized by API |
| Max fan-out          | `MAX_FANOUT = 10` per tool call |
| Dedupe               | `(parentSessionID, callID)` identity, `DEDUPE_MS` window |
| Child context        | Fresh session — no inherited main-LLM context |
| Result surfacing     | Parent patched with `subtask` part pointing at child |

## Robustness

### Retries and respawn

Every child dispatch wraps `create → PATCH-running` in a retry ladder.
The `session.prompt` call is fire-and-forget (non-blocking); prompt
failures are PATCHed to error state on the widget, not retried in-plugin:

| Layer           | Retries                                | Behaviour on failure |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Child create    | Awaited; failure aborts dispatch       | Error surfaces as tool result |
| Part PATCH      | `PATCH_RETRIES = 3`                    | Exponential backoff (`BACKOFF_MS = 100`) |
| Part resolve    | `RESOLVE_RETRIES = 5`                  | Poll parent message for the tool part |
| Child prompt    | Fire-and-forget (no in-plugin retry)   | Widget PATCHed to error state |
| Child timeout   | `CHILD_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 20 min)    | Abort child, PATCH error state |

### Canonical output

Successful dispatch writes this to the parent tool output (so the main LLM
can cite the child and read its final text):

```
task_id: {childID}

<task_result>
{last assistant text from child}
</task_result>
```

Errors surface in `metadata.ouroboros_dispatch_errors`. One failed payload
does **not** abort the rest of a fan-out batch.

### Environment knobs

| Variable                         | Default   | Purpose |
|----------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| `OUROBOROS_CHILD_TIMEOUT_MS`     | 1 200 000 | Per-child overall timeout (ms) |

`OUROBOROS_CHILD_TIMEOUT_MS` is the only variable the bridge reads
(`process.env` appears once, at `opencode/plugin/ouroboros-bridge.ts:38`).

Retries are **not** configurable. The bridge holds two compile-time constants
at `:40-41`: `PATCH_RETRIES = 3`, applied when a PATCH hits a network or server
blip (`:598`), and `RESOLVE_RETRIES = 5`, applied when resolving the assistant
message that hosts a `callID` (`:613`, fails closed and returns `null` if no
exact match is found). Neither responds to an environment variable.

## Installation

Run `ouroboros setup` and select the OpenCode runtime. Install is
**atomic, idempotent, and content-hashed** — reruns are a no-op when the
plugin source is unchanged.

| Platform | Plugin directory |
|----------|------------------|
| Linux    | `~/.config/opencode/plugins/ouroboros-bridge/` (respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/OpenCode/plugins/ouroboros-bridge/` |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\OpenCode\plugins\ouroboros-bridge\` |

What setup guarantees:

- Plugin source copied to the platform directory via `os.replace` (atomic).
- `opencode.json` `plugin` array deduped — stale entries from XDG shifts,
  sudo migrations, or legacy paths are removed, then the canonical path is
  appended.
- SHA-256 content hash compared before writing — identical content is left
  untouched (mtime preserved).

Restart OpenCode after setup. Verify by checking
`<plugin-dir>/bridge.log` — you should see an `INIT` line. If the log is
empty or OpenCode logs `Plugin export is not a function`, confirm the
plugin source still ends with a V1 default export
(`export default { id, server }`) — OpenCode's legacy loader scans every
named export and rejects non-function values like `MAX_BYTES`.

### Manual install (advanced)

Copy `ouroboros-bridge.ts` into the platform plugin directory and add its
path to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["/path/to/plugins/ouroboros-bridge/ouroboros-bridge.ts"]
}
```

## Verifying the plugin

In an OpenCode session with Ouroboros MCP tools available:

```
> run ouroboros_qa against a sample artifact
```

Expected:

1. Tool returns with `task_id: ses_... <task_result>...</task_result>`.
2. A Task pane opens inline under the tool call and streams child work.
3. `bridge.log` gains `DISPATCH tool=ouroboros_qa child=ses_...` lines.

Multi-persona:

```
> ouroboros_lateral_think with persona="all"
```

Expected: five inline Task panes, five distinct `child=ses_...` IDs, and
five independent `<task_result>` blocks — no shared context.

## Troubleshooting

### No `DISPATCH` in log, no Task pane
- Confirm the MCP tool name is prefixed `ouroboros_`.
- Confirm the tool output is valid JSON with `_subagent` or `_subagents`.
- Confirm the plugin path in `opencode.json` resolves to an existing file.

### `ERR` lines in log
Common causes:
- SDK older than v1.4.3. Run `opencode upgrade`.
- Unknown `agent` name — bridge falls back to `general` automatically, but
  a named agent must exist in the roster.
- Child timed out — raise `OUROBOROS_CHILD_TIMEOUT_MS`.

### Raw JSON envelope leaks to main LLM
The plugin hook did not run. Confirm `INIT` line exists in `bridge.log`
and that OpenCode was restarted after install.

### Task panes not inline
If the `subtask` part fails to patch, output falls back to a plain
dispatch note. Check `ERR PATCH part=... status=...` in `bridge.log`.

## Source

Plugin source: `src/ouroboros/opencode/plugin/ouroboros-bridge.ts`.
`ouroboros setup` deploys it to the platform plugin directory and keeps it
in sync on every run via content-hash comparison.
