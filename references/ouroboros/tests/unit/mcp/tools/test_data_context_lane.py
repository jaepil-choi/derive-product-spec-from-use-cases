"""The ``data_context`` advisory lane and the completion rules it needs (#1754).

The lane takes the measurements it names (#1825). These tests pin what remains
true by construction rather than by good behaviour: what the child can express,
what it cannot claim, what completion does when a lane is absent, and what
happens to an output that breaks its contract.

The barrier moved when the lane was allowed to execute. It was "no field holds a
value"; it is now "no value here becomes an answer" -- so the tests that used to
prove a measurement unspellable now prove that everything *around* the
measurement still holds: aggregates only, no claim about the host, and a
required lane that can always answer.

    A question re-emitted on resume, or asked twice in one session, produces the

    text, so a measurement taken for one issuance satisfies the other.

    The original reason for allowing this was that the child returned a proposal
    and never a measurement, so nothing time-sensitive could cross. That stopped
