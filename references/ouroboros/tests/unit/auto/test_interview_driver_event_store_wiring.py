"""RFC #1256 §I4 — `auto.interview.*` lifecycle events reach EventStore.

These tests pin the public contract added by the first-slice wiring:

1. ``AutoInterviewDriver.run`` emits ``auto.interview.opened`` to the
   wired EventStore before the inner loop starts.
2. On a clean return, ``auto.interview.finalized`` is emitted with the
   inner result's ``status`` / ``rounds`` / ``session_id`` / ``blocker``.
3. If the inner loop raises, ``auto.interview.failed`` is emitted before
   the exception propagates and the ``finalized`` event is **not**
   emitted (the wrapper does not swallow exceptions).
4. Without an EventStore the driver behaves exactly as before — no
   appends, no errors. This is the back-compat guarantee that lets every
   pre-existing call site (CLI, MCP handler, unit tests) continue to
   construct the driver without observability wiring.
5. EventStore failures must not break the interview loop — the driver
   logs and continues so the interview surface stays available even when
   the persistence layer is degraded.

    ``AutoPipeline.run`` interview ``asyncio.wait_for(interview_timeout)``
    budget and cause the phase to time out even though the inner
    interview would have completed.

    The bot reproduced this with a 0.05 s wait_for + a 0.2 s blocking
    append: ``TimeoutError`` raised before ``_run_inner`` ran.
    Production ``EventStore.append`` can also wait on SQLite locks
    (``busy_timeout=30000``), so the failure mode is not synthetic.

    Fix: ``_emit_event`` dispatches the append as a background
    ``asyncio.Task`` and returns immediately — see the module-level
    comment in ``interview_driver.py``. The append is bounded by
    ``_EVENT_STORE_EMIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (1.0 s) inside that task,

    the pending tasks — the composition root (``AutoPipeline`` today
    via ``_drain_interview_observer_events``) is responsible for
    draining them OUTSIDE its critical ``wait_for`` so observability
    can never weaken phase-deadline or cancellation contracts.

    append no longer holds up the interview — the inner result is

    drains them to durable persistence.
