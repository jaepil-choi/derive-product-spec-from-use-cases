"""#1889: exactly one caller may own a lineage's evolve_step boundary.

Two concurrent ``evolve_step`` calls used to replay the same lineage state,
select the same generation number, run the external executor twice, and
append duplicate completion and terminal events. The lease serializes the
whole replay/selection/execution boundary per lineage: the loser fails
closed before it can observe a stale snapshot or write lineage-creation
state, a released lease always hands the next caller a fresh replay, and a
crashed owner's lease is reclaimable only after it stops heartbeating —
with the fenced owner's in-flight work aborted if it is still alive.
