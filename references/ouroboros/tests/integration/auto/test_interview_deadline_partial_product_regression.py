"""Integration regression for the #1257 interview-deadline closure ladder.

This file is **PR-D**: the canonical regression evidence layer for the
#1257 work. It binds every contract surface PR-A/B/C added to a single
end-to-end assertion so future refactors cannot silently revert any
piece of the closure ladder. The scenarios are deliberately deterministic
and hermetic — no live LLM, no `OUROBOROS_RUN_CANONICAL=1` opt-in — so
they run in plain CI alongside the existing unit suites.

Coverage:

1. **R4-equivalent timeout fixture.** A pre-armed interview-phase
   deadline against a sleeping driver must:
     - NOT terminate as ``interview_phase_deadline`` BLOCKED,
     - persist a degraded ``Seed`` artifact with the PR-A metadata,
     - append ``runtime.deadline.interview.fired`` (PR-B) and
       ``auto.product.partial_emitted`` (PR-C) to the EventStore,
     - surface the PR-C ``partial_product*`` fields on the result envelope.

2. **Partial product fixture.** A successful deadline run reaches
   ``AutoPhase.COMPLETE`` with ``partial_product=True``, the recovery
   reason mirrored from the Seed, and unresolved slots carried forward
   verbatim as next-step hints.

3. **Raw evidence file.** The integration test writes a JSON evidence
   blob to the pytest tmp path so reviewers can audit the full
   seed/product/event trail without re-running the test.

Per the #1257 spec, #1170 closure remains out of scope; this file only
binds the #1257 regression contract.
