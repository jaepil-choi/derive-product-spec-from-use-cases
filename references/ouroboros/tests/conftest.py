# ── Hermetic home isolation (before collection) ──────────────────────────────
# Ouroboros resolves its state root two ways: ``Path.home()`` AND
# ``os.path.expanduser("~")`` (e.g. cli/commands/{cancel,run,job,resume,tui}.py
# build the default ``EventStore`` DB path via ``expanduser``). ``$HOME`` is the
# single chokepoint both go through — ``Path.home()`` calls ``expanduser("~")``
# internally — so redirecting ``$HOME`` isolates config, the default DB, logs,
# and dynamically resolved CLI persistence defaults in one move, and
# subprocesses spawned by tests inherit the isolated home instead of the real
# one. We set it at conftest import — *before* collection — so it also covers
# effects the per-test fixture cannot reach (module-level constants, a logging
# handler opening ``~/.ouroboros/logs/ouroboros.log``, ``config.loader`` reading
# ``~/.ouroboros/.env`` at import).
#
# External tools that legitimately need the real home get an explicit location:
# ``uv build`` (exercised by the wheel-packaging test) keeps its real cache via
# ``UV_CACHE_DIR``. git fixtures set per-repo identity, so no global git config
# is required under the isolated home.
_REAL_HOME = Path(os.path.expanduser("~"))
_SESSION_HOME = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="ouroboros-test-home-"))

    * Runtime-inference tests read the developer's real ``config.yaml``
      ``runtime_profile`` (e.g. ``interview: codex``) and fail locally with
      ``codex != opencode`` while passing on CI's empty home — the classic
      "passes on CI, fails on my machine" split.
    * A no-arg ``EventStore()`` writes into a single shared ``ouroboros.db``;
